# War Thunder ApplePie Assistant
 - This is a dumb little script I wrote for the summer classes of image recongnition. First of all, it can't farm. Also, it's not a cheat. The main point of this whole project is to intergrate games with OpenCV, and being able to click on respective buttons when in different pages of a game. I modified the code a bit so that it works on repeat for War Thunder naval AB/RB.  
 - You can view it as a bot script or whatever, I don't really care, but trust me when I say it doesn't work like a bot. Tried it, pretty unefficiant. Bot scripts these days are not dumb anymore, they use much more advanced image recongition algorithms with machine learning involved, for example, locating the little green indicator then read the distance off the scrren, or auto pilot avoiding the terrans by reading off the map, that I'm still struggling to learn. The days of switching to antiair, rush, die, and hope the main guns gets someone are over, often times you would find most bot accounts having much better stats than humans now. But then again, those kind of bots costs like 30 bucks a month.   
 - If you are that desperate to use this, by all means. If too many people complains about it, I'll private this repository.

## 战争雷霆苹果派助手
 - 本软件是大学暑期图像识别基础课课上实践作业，主要的点为在游戏中根据不同页面点击对应的图标。没有用到什么高深技术，现结课后根据规定修改后免费公开，请勿在技术学习范畴之外使用或售卖本软件，违者后果自负。  
 - 首先，请不要指望着用这个当做海战脚本刷钱，然后，这也不是外挂，没有自动提前量的，bug还贼多，还不会避障。本质上就是学OpenCV的产物，当个大学基础实践看就是了。
   - 目前效果是稳定运行3小时后卡死，30万银狮，共15局，其中1局为消极局。
 - 如果你游戏打得银狮掉得只能用脚本了，那……想拿去用就拿去咯。反正我话放在这里了，出了事也别找我，被骂了也别找我，我这边来的人要是多起来了我就把这个repo给private掉了  
### 为啥叫苹果派助手啊？
 - 个人习惯版本号用26个英文字母开头的单词（谷歌：？）版本1为ApplePie，版本2为BlueberryPie，版本3为CranberryPie
